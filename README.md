Hi this is Ayush Singh and this is my repository for the tasks given to me by the IT company "PRODIGY INFOTECH" where i am currently working as a "MACHINE LEARNING INTERN". The ML_02 repository consists of the task 02

Project Title: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to implement a K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. By identifying distinct customer groups, the retail store can tailor its marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize sales.

Project Description:
In this project, we aim to analyze the purchase history of customers and cluster them into meaningful groups using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The dataset used for this project includes various details such as customer ID, purchase amount, frequency of purchases, product categories, and transaction dates.

The project workflow includes the following steps:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the dataset containing customer purchase history.
Explore the data to understand the structure and distribution of features.
Handle any missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features from the dataset, such as total purchase amount, purchase frequency, and recency of last purchase.
Normalize the features to ensure they contribute equally to the clustering process.
Model Development:

Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis.
Assign customers to clusters and analyze the characteristics of each cluster.
Cluster Analysis:

Visualize the clusters to gain insights into customer segments.
Interpret the clusters to understand common traits and behaviors within each group.
Business Insights and Recommendations:

Provide actionable insights based on the clustering results.
Recommend strategies for personalized marketing, targeted promotions, and inventory management.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the power of K-Means clustering in customer segmentation, providing valuable insights into the purchasing behavior of retail store customers. By identifying distinct customer segments, the retail store can tailor its marketing efforts to better meet the needs of each group, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and driving sales growth.

The successful implementation of this project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in retail. The K-Means clustering algorithm proved to be an effective tool for uncovering hidden patterns in customer data, enabling the retail store to make informed business decisions.

This project has been an enriching experience, allowing me to apply clustering techniques to real-world data and derive meaningful insights. I am grateful to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with this opportunity as part of their Machine Learning Internship Program. Their guidance and support have been instrumental in the successful completion of this project
